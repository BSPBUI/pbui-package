pbui-client is the npm package for PBUI, created by Heggo and Ultraslayyy to aid in the running of Beat Saber tournaments, the picks and bans portion specifically.

Currently, this package only 100% supports Typescript, but full ES6 JS and (hopefully) CJS support will be coming within the next few patches.

## This package is still in Beta
